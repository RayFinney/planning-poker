# Planning Poker - The Un-Framework

Welcome to the most revolutionary piece of software engineering you've witnessed this decade. We have achieved the impossible: a web application that runs without three different transpilers, a 500MB `node_modules` directory, or a PhD in state management.

This is Planning Poker. It's fast, it's simple, and it's written in technologies so old-school, they're practically vintage.

## Are You Tired Of...

-   React-based planning poker apps that take longer to load than it takes to actually plan your sprint?
-   Angular projects that require a team of 10 to simply add a button?
-   Vue applications that have more dependencies than a Fortune 500 company?
-   The existential dread of running `npm install` and watching your hard drive slowly disappear?

Then you've come to the right place.

## Features That Will Blow Your Mind (Probably)

-   **Blazing Fast™:** We use Vanilla JS. It's like driving a manual car - no fancy automatic transmissions, just pure, unadulterated speed.
-   **Zero Frontend Frameworks:** That's right. We looked at React, Vue, and Angular and said, "Nah, we're good."
-   **Minimal Dependencies:** Our backend is a single Go binary. The frontend is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's it. No, seriously.
-   **Real-Time™:** We use WebSockets, a technology so powerful, it's been around since the dawn of time (2011).
-   **Styling by Tailwind CSS:** Because writing custom CSS is a soul-crushing experience we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies.

## The "Why" - A Manifesto

We believe in the sanctity of simplicity. We believe that a planning poker app shouldn't require a dedicated DevOps team to deploy. We believe that you should be able to read the source code without having a stroke.

We also believe that you shouldn't have to pay a yearly subscription for a tool that could be built in a weekend. This project is a testament to that belief. While other "free" services limit you to a handful of votes before hitting a paywall, we offer a truly free and open-source solution. No limits, no subscriptions, no nonsense.

This project is a statement. A rebellion against the tyranny of over-engineering and the absurdity of freemium models for basic tools. A shining beacon of hope in a world drowning in JavaScript fatigue and unnecessary subscriptions.

## Getting Started

Prepare for the easiest setup of your life.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/planning-poker.git
    ```
2.  **Run the backend:**
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
3.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

That's it. You're done. No, we're not kidding.
